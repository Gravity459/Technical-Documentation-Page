# Technical Documentation Page

This is the Technical Documentation Page assigned by the Free Code Camp Course.

This project is one of the starting projects for me and it can help any beginner in pursuit of starting with HTML/CSS.

The live preview for the site is at: https://gravity459.github.io/Technical-Documentation-Page/
