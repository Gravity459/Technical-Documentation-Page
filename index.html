                C is a general-purpose high level language that was originally developed 
                by Dennis Ritchie for the Unix operating system. It was first implemented 
                on the Digital Eqquipment Corporation PDP-11 computer in 1972. The Unix operating 
                system and virtually all Unix applications are written in the C language.
                The main features of the C language include low-level memory access, 
                a simple set of keywords, and a clean style, these features make C language 
                suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development.

                The Unix operating system and virtually all Unix applications are 
                written in the C language. C has now become a widely used professional 
                language for various reasons.

                The C programming language came out of <strong><u>Bell Labs</u></strong> in the early 1970s. 
                According to the Bell Labs paper The Development of the C Language by
                <strong><u>Dennis Ritchie</u></strong>, <strong>"The C programming language was devised in the early 
                1970s as a system implementation language for the nascent Unix operating 
                system. Derived from the typeless language BCPL, it evolved a type 
                structure; created on a tiny machine as a tool to improve a meager 
                programming environment."</strong> 
            </p>
            <p>
                Originally, Ken Thompson, a Bell Labs employee, desired to make a p
                rogramming language for the new Unix platform. Thompson 
                modified the BCPL system language and created B. However, not many utilities 
                were ever written in B due to its slow nature and inability to take advantage 
                of PDP-11 features in the operating system. This led to Ritchie improving on B, 
                and thus creating C.

                <h1>First Program In C</h1>
            </header>
            <p>
                The first program for every person to implement in any
                new language is the one and only " <strong><u>Hello World</u></strong> "
                program. In C, this program is written with a pre-defined function called 
                printf() which outputs anything you want to print onto the console. The 
                code for Hello World is given below:
            </p>
            <code>
                int main(){                 
                    printf("Hello World");  
                }                           
            </code>
        </section>

                <h1>Variables & Constants</h1>
            </header>
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>
                In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data. 
                To indicate the storage area, each variable should be given a unique 
                name (identifier). Variable names are just the symbolic representation 
                of a memory location. For example:
            </p>
            <code>
                int playerScore = 95;
            </code>
            <p>
                Here, playerScore is a variable of int type. Here, the variable is assigned 
                an integer value 95. 
            </br>
            </br>
                The value of a variable can be changed, hence the name variable.
            </p>
            <code>
                char ch = 'a';
                // some code
                ch = 'l';
            </code>
            <h2>Constants</h2>
            <p>
                If you want to define a variable whose value cannot be changed, 
                you can use the const keyword. This will create a constant. For example,
            </p>
            <code>
                const double PI = 3.14;
            </code>
            <p>
                Notice, we have added keyword const. 
                Here, PI is a symbolic constant; its value cannot be changed.
            </p>
            <code>
                const double PI = 3.14;
                PI = 2.9; //Error
            </code>

                <h1>Data Types</h1>
            </header>
            <p>
                In this tutorial, you will learn about basic data 
                types such as int, float, char etc. in C programming.
            </p>
            <p>
                In C programming, data types are declarations for 
                variables. This determines the type and size of data 
                associated with variables. For example,
            </p>
            <code>
                int myVar;
            </code>
            <p>
                There are other variables too which include:
                <ul>
                    <li>int</li>
                    <li>float and double</li>
                    <li>char</li>
                    <li>void</li>
                    <li>short and long</li>
                    <li>signed and unsigned</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

        <section id="Input/Output_in_C" class="main-section">

                <h1>Input/Output in C</h1>
            </header>
            <h2>C Output</h2>
            <p>
                In C programming, printf() is one of the main output function. 
                The function sends formatted output to the screen. For example,
            </p>
            <code>
                <span id="linebreaker">
                    #include <stdio.h>   
                </span>
                
                <span id="linebreaker">
                    int main() {
                </span>

                <span id="linebreaker">
                    // Displays the string inside quotations 
                </span>
                
                <span id="linebreaker">
                   printf("C Programming");
                </span>

                <span id="linebreaker">
                    return 0;
                </span>
                        
                <span id="linebreaker">
                    }
                </span>
